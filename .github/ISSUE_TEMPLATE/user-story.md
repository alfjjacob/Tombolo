## Short Descriptor
Brief explanation of the feature.
### Details
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
### Acceptance Criteria
This basically gives engineers a pre-test that they can run before the end of sprint/demo, so that all use cases that are ready for the sprint should be accepted.  Any defects that are not identified by the Acceptance Criteria would then be considered issues to address in a future sprint.
